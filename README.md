    <p>If you want to study in Russia but do not know the language, it is not a problem since many universities offer programmes in English. In addition, universities often offer preparatory Russian courses for foreigners, who normally need one year to master the basics. Before you start studies in your chosen major, you can study at the preparatory departments of Russian universities for international applicants for one year. Usually, the preparatory course includes 20 to 36 hours of Russian classes per week as well as certain other general subjects depending on your further studies. You may check your knowledge of Russian right now by taking our special test. </p>
